    <h2><u>MY CLASSROOM</u></h2>
    <div>
    <p>A classroom is a place or room where classes take place. Each of us has memories attached to our classroom. We
        spend most of our time in class and learn most of our life's beautiful and essential lessons. I also have some
        memories of my classroom. Here are a few sample essays on “My classroom”.</p>

    <h4>IN OUR CLASSROOM</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>green board</li>
        <li>duster</li>
        <li>chalk</li>

        <li>study table</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>INSIDE MY CLASSROOM</u></h2>
    
    <div><P>Also, my classroom is beautifully decorated by the children. We always clean the classroom and throw the waste
        only in dustbins. Thus, my classroom is the favourite of all the teachers of our school. When the principal
        announced the cleanliness drive and best clean classroom award, my classroom was positioned at number one.

        Also, there is an achievement wall in my classroom where we record the achievements of our class students.
        During sports day, my classroom bagged the first prize. For every person, there is some special place where they
        like to spend time. For me, it's my classroom where I love to spend my maximum time, and each day, I learn
        something new and valuable. I love my classroom very much</P></div>

    <h2><u>MY CLASSROOM-AN ENJOYABLE PLACE</u></h2>
    <div>
    <P>My classroom has two enormous windows and a big door, and it is pretty enjoyable, roomy, airy, and ventilated due
        to the presence of many trees. A large whiteboard and four ceiling fans are present. We write a quote on the
        whiteboard daily which motivates us to do best in our lives. My classroom has several artworks that are
        well-decorated on the walls. We decorated the walls with maps, charts, and images of flowers, trees, and the
        solar system. The decent environment of my classroom motivates me to go there daily.

        Another reason I enjoy my class is the teacher, who is always so kind and encourages us to participate in
        various activities. She always motivates us to participate in competitions with the management of studies. She
        inspires us to be perfect both in academic as well as extracurricular activities.</P></div>
    <h2><u>BEST CLASSROOM</u></h2>
    <div>
    <P>My classroom is different from the whole school. This is because various students in my classroom are best in
        various fields. The sports students always bring medals in state and national level tournaments. Every year, the
        school, as well as state toppers, come from my classroom</P></div>

    <h2><u>MY CLASSROOM EXPERIANCE</u></h2>
    <div>
    <P>I like enjoying nature and love to spend time in nature. The natural environment of my classroom gives me the
        same feeling as many beautiful flowers and trees are in front of my classroom. I have also grown some of them.

        I love to decorate the classroom walls with beautiful crafts and academic charts. Also, there is a knowledge
        wall where I paste important current affairs newspaper cuttings daily. During the festive seasons, I also give
        my contribution to class decoration. I decorate the classroom with rangoli, light diyas and candles on Diwali. I
        also participate in quizzes and essay competitions. Thus, the classroom is a precious memory for me.

        A classroom is the soul of every student. We will always remember this place as being unforgettably memorable.
        What we become in real life is shaped by school. It had a fantastic effect on students for the rest of their
        lives. All of us enjoy ourselves a lot in school. The relevance of the classroom for students and youngsters is
        beyond words. Though some children don't like going to school after they pass out, they miss it the most</P></div></main>
